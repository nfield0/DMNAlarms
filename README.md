# DMNAlarms

Our IoT application is an alarm system for single-entry rooms containing valuable documents of some form. After passing fingerprint and facial recognition, the electric strike door lock is unlocked, and entry is granted. There is a door sensor to detect when the door is open and closed. A Database is used to store fingerprint, facial images, date, and time of access. Each stage of the process is accompanied by a speaker, buzzer, and LCD display to guide the user through the system. A flask website is to be used to facilitate a typical front-end user.
